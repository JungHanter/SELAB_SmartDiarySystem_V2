    """I dated this guy named Sam for a year and a half. I was with him the summer before sophomore year, all of summer year, the summer after sophomore year, and half of junior year. So that relationship alone takes up most of my high school experience... I look back on memories and they're all with him. It kinda sucks because even to this day, I am over him completely but I still see myself with only him. I think the sole reason for that is because of how comfortable I was with him and he never ever judged me, and he didn't even want sex, and i feel like I won't have that with anyone else. He had so many flaws, and there were more things I didn't like than things that I did, and our relationship would not work out, but i still see myself with him. I'm just afraid that I'll never find that with anyone else, and starting over with anyone else just seems so scary and it's like starting all over from the very beginning... falling in love all over again, and to be honest I don't even want to do that because he hurt me so bad because I was so in love and I do not want that to happen again... however I cannot spend my life in fear.""",
    """Homecoming week is going to brake me. I have my homecoming dress for the dance, i need to get heels, I need to get a shirt for speedaway, I need to get a color day shirt, and i am going to make a shirt for senior white out. I am losing so much money, but I will still get it back. I just hate spending this much money in a such a short time span.""",
    """So I found my homecoming dress already and purchased it. It is a tank top style dress and then upper part is tight while the bottom is loose and straight. It is glittery and lacy. I don't know if I want to wear black or red heels yet... I was thinking red but that depends on if I can find ones I like in a store that isn't online.""",
    """Crazy how it's already September first. I only have around three months of school left and I am honestly so excited! I cannot wait to be done! It sucks because I honestly feel like I have no friends in school. I have people I talk to, but I only talk to those people in class. They're not people who talk to me outside of school, and it makes me sad because I would like to talk to them outside of school... I just never feel good enough. That's the main reason I hate high school, because in all honesty, I'm a loner.""",
    """I am in one of those moods where I just want to take a blade, watch my skin come apart and blood come out. I feel so alone, worthless, empty. My mom makes me feel happy and good about myself, but she is the only one. Whenever I think about school I realize how alone i really am, and how I don't have many friends. Whenever I need someone to talk to, I never have anyone to go to. That's when I realize that i don't have many friends. It honestly really sucks because I feel like I am a good friend, but nobody really gives me the time of day. They talk to me in school but outside of school I don't hear from any of them unless it is related to school. I really want to go to homecoming, and it makes me sad because I have absolutely nobody to go with. That's been my whole problem, when I started dating Sam, I lost my friend group, and now i just don't talk to them and they never tried to talk to me. I don't want to miss football games, dances, prom and even graduation, but I have nobody to go with because I don't have any real outside of school friends... and it sucks. I don't know what's so wrong with me to where i don't have any actual friends. It really hurts. I never feel wanted around the people who talk to me at school either, I feel like I'm just kind of there. Nobody really talks to me unless I talk to them first. That's also why I cannot wait until college so I can shake that image and make friends who are real friends, who i can do stuff with. Thinking about it makes me so sad and brings me so down.""",
    """I have decided to go to homecoming. I didn't plan on going at first, but then changed my mind. I changed my mind because it is my senior year and I do want to remember as many things from this year as possible. I am graduating early but I am still going to walk, I am still going to homecoming, I am still going to senior banquet... the only thing I am unsure of is prom. That depends if I have someone to go with or not. I am looking forward to everything this year brings though, even though I do hate school so much.""",
    """I CANNOT GET OVER TOMMY. It is annoying the absolute hell out of me. I know he does not, and most likely never will, feel the same way back towards me. It really sucks because I like him a lot. I have to work with him and see him and it makes things hard because during those times he is always making me laugh and smile and happy and i enjoy it so much. I just enjoy his company and his presence and just him as a whole.""",
    """There is so much drama going on at work right now. I don't even wanna discuss it because of how childish it is! It makes me so mad that some people can get away with acting like such a child like it's not a big deal. This girl seriously quit over text, came in crying and then got her job back. Why would you give someone their job back after they quit over text? I do not understand.""",
    """It is the last day of the month, so you know what that means!? MONTHLY INVENTORY AT WORK. This is awful. We are stuck there until we count every single thing in the store, and we are usually there an hour past when we are supposed to get out. It doesn't help that I have school tomorrow and I just wanna get home on the quicks and sleep. It is kind of annoying how they make us do that. It should be a job for the managers, but I guess it's part of being an adult... doing things you do't want to.""",
    """I told my best friend that I have feelings for him, and got rejected, sort of. I was basically told that I am only a friend which I understand... I don't want a boyfriend anyway. It just kind of sucks because I didn't purposely develop these feelings nor did I want them, they just happened. I wish moving on was a quicker process than it is, but it isn't. I'll get over it eventually, but for right now, I have to deal with it.""",
    """For some odd reason, I feel like I am starting to spiral back down into my sadness. I can't figure out why, but I feel like I have lost most of my happiness just over the course of a few hours. Maybe it is because Tommy doesn't like have feelings for me back, or because I feel like my best friend, but whatever it is, I just feel like I am going back into a deep dark hole that was so hard to crawl out of. I want to stop it before it gets too bad, but I just don't know how to stop it. It makes me sad knowing that no matter how hard I try, I just cannot completely prevent it. It really sucks.""",
    """In school I am taking two different English classes. English four, which is the basic senior english, and Rhetoric, which is college level English. In both of my classes I am writing personal statements that we can use for college applications, however, I am already committed to a college. Since I am already committed to a college I wrote about why I want to go into child psychology. I wrote about my struggle with depression and self-harm and I am afraid my teachers might look at me different now. I don't really mind it, I just don't want to get treated different. I feel like my paper turned out very well, I just think that I am going to get secretly judged or they're going to be sympathetic which I do not want.""",
    """I feel like there are so many people in this world who could be so much nicer than they are. There are so many people nowadays who are rude and have an ugly personality and it is just so unnecessary. Everyone has potential to be nice caring, kind and respectful but NOBODY DOES THAT. It just sickens me knowing that people have this chance and they pass it up. Be nice to everyone and make the world a better place.""",
    """I never realized how far I've come with self-harm until just now. I look back and realize that I hurt myself a lot, ever since middle school. I never really considered it a problem, but now that I don't do it anymore I see it as just a surprise. I don't even know how it feels to be that sad since I am no longer that sad anymore. I was always so depressed and I always wanted to self-harm and I think the main problem was because of Sam. I am so happy now to the point where I cannot even imagine myself being that sad. It is great how far you can come when you kick the negative people out of your life. Im so happy I never actually attempted suicide like I thought about. I am so happy now, I am so proud of where I am.""",
    """I had to rush my mom to the hospital today, and it was the scairiest thing ever. It really made me realize how much I love my mom. I cried so much before going into the hospital. Turns out she has a kidney stone on each kidney, and that's nothing good, but it's better than some things that it could have been. We went in not knowing what was wrong, and i'm so glad it wasn't something that could result in death. I have never been that scared before and I will never again take my moms name in vain.""",
    """Dear ex boyfriend, I just wanted to let you know that I do not regret our relationship in way, shape or form. I learned a lot from the year and a half I was with you, and I will use everything I learned for future relationships. The first thing that I learned is that if we break up even one time, chances are we are going to break up again, and again, and again, so there is no point of constantly getting back together. I also learned that if someone doesn't treat me like I am a priority then i need to leave them because I deserve to be prioritized. I also learned that I need to not take the blame for everything. Every single problem our relationship faced I would take the blame for and that made me feel like absolute shit. I never should be with someone who makes me self-harm and be depressed, and that is exactly what my last relationship did. I will never settle ever again. My next boyfriend will treat me like a queen and i will treat him like a king... end of story.""",
    """I could definitely make this guy happy and give him the whole world and more, but he only looks at me as a best friend and I only look at him as a best friend... well I think. Again, I just do not know. I wish there was a way to talk out my feelings and come to a realization but I think it'll take more than talking to figure it out and it honestly really sucks man.""",
    """I really don't know how I feel about this guy. He makes me smile and he makes me laugh and he is just so cute but at the same time he annoys me and he acts like such a child. I just cannot put my feelings together and figure it out. I'm just taking it day by day but I wish I knew now. I hate playing this waiting game but I have no choice when I don't know how I feel. It is one big complicated situation that I wish I wasn't in and it doesn't help that I work with him and he is my best friend.""",
    """I currently am working at a produce store making $9.00/hour, however that is not enough for me. I am graduating high school in December so I will have 7 months of no school and nothing to do, so I made a plan. I turn 18 in November, so in December before I am out of school I am going to start applying for full time day positions at places that pay more than $9.00/hour. As well as finding a day job that pays more than $9.00, I want to apply at places to work 3rd shift, aka all night. I want to work a full time day job and either a part or full time night job. My reasoning behind this is because I do not want to start college next year with car payments that are forcing me to get a job. I want to have my freshman year of college without a job so I can adjust to the college life, and then work as a sophomore. I am hoping I'll have luck finding a full time day job that pays more than $9.00.""",
    """I have a lot of cute dates that I would love to go on and I just want to take a second to list some of them. 1. A date to the zoo during the winter so you can see all the Christmas lights and the trees and all the pretty decor. 2. A date to a pumpkin patch in the fall time so we can play in hay stacks and go on hay rides and pick out pumpkins that we will carve together. 3. A water park date because it is a fun way to keep cool when it is hot out, and you have an excuse to show them how you look without make up on. 4. A movie night! Not like a movie night where it turns sexual, but like a genuine movie night where we cuddle and watch movies the whole night. 5. a night under the stars. I would love a night with my man where we just go out at night and sit outside on a picnic blanket in a pretty park somewhere in a field and watch the stars and just talk about anything and everything and really have an intimate, getting to you know you kind of evening (Can't forget the bug spray!) 6. A date to the city. I would love a date to the city in the spring time where we can just walk around and see all the pretty sites, go to navy pier, stay until it gets dark and see the lit up buildings and walk along the lake. I would just love to go on a date like one of these, but they don't seem to exist anymore and it's honestly pretty sad.""",
    """This one is going to be a short and simple entry all about my excitement for college! I am so excited for next year and to start college and the new chapter in my life! I cannot wait to call Ames, Iowa my home away from home. I have never been this excited... the next time I feel like this will probably be for graduation. I am so obsessed with Iowa State and i am so beyond happy with my choice!"""
