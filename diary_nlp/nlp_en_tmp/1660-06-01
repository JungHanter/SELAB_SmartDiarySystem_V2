At the end of the last and the beginning of this year, I do live in one of the houses belonging to the Navy Office, as one of the principal officers, and have done now about half a year.
After much trouble with workmen I'm now almost settled my family being, myself, my wife, Jane, Will.Hewer, and Wayne, my girl's brother.
Myself in constant good health, and in a most handsome and thriving condition.
Blessed be Almighty God for it.
I am now taking of my sister to come and live with me.
As to things of State. The King settled, and loved of all.
The Duke of York matched to my Lord Chancellor's daughter, which do not please many.
The Queen upon her return to France with the Princess Henrietta.
The Princess of Orange lately dead, and we into new mourning for her.
We have been lately frighted with a great plot, and many taken up on it, and the fright not quite over.
The Parliament, which had done all this great good to the King, beginning to grow factious, the King did dissolve it December 29th last, and another likely to be chosen speedily.
I take myself now to be worth L300 clear in money, and all my goods and all manner of debts paid, which are none at all.
