As a rule, I get up far too late.
Then I attempt to start working in the bar so I can get a croissant and a coffee, then lunch, the culmination of breakfast.
Then it's work, work, work, and from there off to chapel to sing for an hour.
Having done this, there is more lovely work to take up the time until dinner.
I tend not to work in the evening.
As for social activities I particularly enjoy parties in people's rooms and various missions to the pubs and to Grantchester.
It is quite amazing how one can just walk towards Grantchester and get out of town so quickly, and the country is really lovely.
