My normal day… well it very much depends as the politics department itself doesn't schedule many lectures (or didn't in the second year), so it's quite inconsistent whether I'll be going to lectures – depends whether the history dept are putting on any interesting/useful ones.

But assume I've got a 10 o'clock one. Go to that and then get a coffee and doughnut. Try to do some work before lunch, always from a sandwich shop. Eat it whilst watching neighbours. Then hopefully do some serious hours of work in the afternoon, maybe popping into town for a break to stock up supplies or go to the bank.

Hall for dinner at 6 o'clock. If I'm working hard then work after that, otherwise read/watch television/wander about with mates until going to pub. I also go to quite a lot of plays. There is a huge amount of student drama going on here, some of it really decent. If I'm working late I do tend to try to get a pint in at last orders, so I can look forward to something while being so diligent!
